        <h1 class="xlarge-font"><b>Content marketing ?</b></h1>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:24px">As mentioned, the quality of your content is a key component of an optimized page. As a result, SEO is a major factor in content marketing, a strategy based on the distribution of relevant and valuable content to a target audience.
            As in any marketing strategy, the goal of content marketing is to attract leads that ultimately convert into customers. But it does so differently than traditional advertising. Instead of enticing prospects with potential value from a product or service, it offers value for free in the form of written material, such as:
            •	Blog posts
            •	E-books
            •	Newsletters
            •	Video or audio transcripts
            •	Whitepapers
            •	Infographics
            Content marketing matters, and there are plenty of stats to prove it:
            •	84% of consumers expect companies to produce entertaining and helpful content experiences
            •	62% of companies that have at least 5,000 employees produce content daily
            •	92% of marketers believe that their company values content as an important asset
            As effective as content marketing is, it can be tricky. Content marketing writers need to be able to rank highly in search engine results while also engaging people who will read the material, share it, and interact further with the brand. When the content is relevant, it can establish strong relationships throughout the pipeline.
            To create effective content that’s highly relevant and engaging, it’s important to identify your audience. Who are you ultimately trying to reach with your content marketing efforts? Once you have a better grasp of your audience, you can determine the type of content you'll create. You can use many formats of content in your content marketing, including videos, blog posts, printable worksheets, and more.
            Regardless of which content you create, it’s a good idea to follow content marketing best practices. This means making content that’s grammatically correct, free of errors, easy to understand, relevant, and interesting. Your content should also funnel readers to the next stage in the pipeline, whether that’s a free consultation with a sales representative or a signup page.

        <p><span style="font-size:36px">Social media marketing means driving traffic and brand awareness by engaging people  .</span>in discussion online. You can use social media marketing to highlight your brand, products, services, culture, and more. With billions of people spending their time engaging on social media platforms, focusing on social media marketing can be worthwhile.
            The most popular digital platforms for social media marketing are Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, with LinkedIn and YouTube not far behind. Ultimately, which social media platforms you use for your business depends on your goals and audience. For example, if you want to find new leads for your FinTech startup, targeting your audience on LinkedIn is a good idea since industry professionals are active on the platform. On the other hand, running social media ads on Instagram may be better for your brand if you run a B2C focused on younger consumers.
            Because social media marketing involves active audience participation, it has become a popular way of getting attention. It's the most popular content medium for B2C digital marketers at 96%, and it's gaining ground in the B2B sphere as well. According to the Content Marketing Institute, 61% of B2B content marketers increased their use of social media this year.
            Social media marketing offers built-in engagement metrics, which are extremely useful in helping you to understand how well you're reaching your audience. You get to decide which types of interactions mean the most to you, whether that means the number of shares, comments, or total clicks to your website.
            Direct purchase may not even be a goal of your social media marketing strategy. Many brands use social media marketing to start dialogues with audiences rather than encourage them to spend money right away. This is especially common in brands that target older audiences or offer products and services not appropriate for impulse buys. It all depends on your company's social media marketing goals.

        <h1 class="xlarge-font"><b>Marketing automation?</b></h1>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:24px">Marketing automation uses software to power digital marketing campaigns, improving the efficiency and relevance of advertising. As a result, you can focus on creating the strategy behind your digital marketing efforts instead of cumbersome and time-consuming processes.
          While marketing automation may seem like a luxury tool your business can do without, it can significantly improve the engagement between you and your audience.
          According to statistics:
          •	90% of US consumers find personalization either “very” or “somewhat” appealing
          •	81% of consumers would like the brands they engage with to understand them better
          •	77% of companies believe in the value of real-time personalization, yet 60% struggle with it
          Marketing automation lets companies keep up with the expectation of personalization. It allows brands to:
          •	Collect and analyze consumer information
          •	Design targeted marketing campaigns
          •	Send and post digital marketing messages at the right times to the right audiences
          Many marketing automation tools use prospect engagement (or lack thereof) with a particular message to determine when and how to reach out next. This level of real-time customization means that you can effectively create an individualized marketing strategy for each customer without any additional time investment.
          Mailchimp's marketing automation tools ensure you can interact with your audience via behavior-based automations, transactional emails, date-based automations, and more.
